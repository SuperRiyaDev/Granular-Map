## How to use 

- Use the search input field to type the city or places you want to search for and then hit search button (if it doesn't works on one click try clicking it again!).

- Try searching with specific city/district(e.g. raipur) names for better results as the web app will provide the list of places filtered with administrative boundaries.

- To share the link with other user use the share button which will copy the link to clipboard.

- For some search results if the polygon doesn't shows up then try zooming in and if in that case also it doesn't work then there must be no data for the same.

- For recent search result scroll down the page and there will the recent search component.

- You can click on any recent search list to go that particular search result.
